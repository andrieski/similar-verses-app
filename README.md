This project is ultimately a web app that aims to help users find similar bible
verses using cosine similarity. In combination with other online tools, this may
be useful. Complex verses may be better understood by reading similar passages
in different contexts.

The app lets the user pick a verse and search for similar verses, letting the
user also view the similar verses in context. View the app in action at
https://andrieski.github.io/similar-verses-app/. Bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
